# Ecommerce_Showcase (in progress)
This is one of my portfolio projects - a fully fledged ecommerce website.
This is a full stack app (MERN stack) using Firebase.

## The Goal of this project

Firstly I am using this project to further familiarize myself with React Library - However there are a few new things I want to familiarize myself with, namely:

<li> Style Components
<li> Firebase
<li> Stripe API & Context API
<li> Redux & Redux Saga & Thunk
<li> GraphQL & Apollo


Further there are a few things I want to do to simulate some real world practice.
<li> Initially build this with Vanilla JavaScript and later convert it into a TypeScript Project
<li> Initially style this project with Styled Components and then later convert to JS library
<li> I want to practice writing some tests for this project with Jest and Snapshot Testing




# How I built this:  

This is supposed to be a sort of "Code with me - Diary".
As well as a way for me to remember what I have done while building this project. 

### Scaffolding the Vite Project


1.  Firstly I am using Vite (pronounced 'Veet') - So simply just running
    npm create vite@latest


2.  Clearing up some of the unnecessary and boiler plate code


3.  Adding and setting up SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
    npm install sass


4.  Setting up the most essential folder structure for components
