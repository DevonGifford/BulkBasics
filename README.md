# Ecommerce_Showcase (in progress)
This is one of my portfolio projects - a fully fledged ecommerce website.
This is a full stack app (MERN stack) using Firebase.

## The Goal of this project

Firstly I am using this project to further familiarize myself with React Library - However there are a few new things I want to familiarize myself with, namely:

<li> Style Components
<li> Firebase
<li> Stripe API & Context API
<li> Redux & Redux Saga & Thunk
<li> GraphQL & Apollo


Further there are a few things I want to do to simulate some real world practice.
<li> Initially build this with Vanilla JavaScript and later convert it into a TypeScript Project
<li> Initially style this project with Styled Components and then later convert to JS library
<li> I want to practice writing some tests for this project with Jest and Snapshot Testing




# How I built this:  

This is supposed to be a sort of "Code with me - Diary".
As well as a way for me to remember what I have done while building this project. 

### Scaffolding the Vite/React Project
<hr>

[Vite doc's](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

1.  #### Using Vite (pronounced 'Veet'ðŸ¤”) 
    `npm create vite@latest`

2.  #### Clearing up some of the unnecessary and boiler plate code

3.  #### Adding and setting up SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
    `npm install sass`

    registered the Ecommerce-projec/app in the FireBase web-console

2.  #### Installed the SDK and initialized Firebase
        -   npm install firebase
        -   Added a `Utils` Folder with `FireBase folder` 
        -   Added file called `firebase.utils`

3.  #### Created access for Firebase in the app - via  `firebase.utils`
        -   import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
        -   Setting up authentication
            Import {} from `firebase/auth`;
                -  getAuth
                -  signInWithRedirect,
                -  signInWithPopup,

        -   Creating Async Sign-in Function/Method to get access token
<br><br>    

### Setting up Firestore Data Model

<hr>

[Cloud Firestore Doc's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
Obviously we are just using FireBase for authentication.  To be able to store the users, I will need a database.
Enter Cloud FireStore.

1.  ##### Created a production FireStore database 
    via web-console and based in EU
    amended the rules 

2.  ##### Imported the necessary methods into Firebase utils 
    -  { getFirestore,  doc, getDoc,  setDoc }

3.  ##### Created a method to store users data from authentication
    -  used an if statement with try block, 
       so as if user does not exist do 'x' or else return user.
    - used a catch block , so as if an error occurs console.log the error.
    - logging date data for creation of new users (new Data()).

4.  ##### Additionally, installed a package to handle the import of SVG Files
    -  `npm install vite-plugin-svgr`
    -   Updated the vite.config.js

<br><br>


### Experimenting with a Google Redirect Sign in 

<hr> 

1. #### Importing `GoogleRedirect` from `firebase/auth` into utils

2. #### Setting up Sign-in Component
    -  Using `useEffect` Hook from `react`
    -  Using `getRedirectResult` from `firebase/auth`
    -  Amended the SignIn method to incorporate the above

<br><br>

### Setting up email & password - sign-up & sign-in

<hr>

1.  ##### Adding a new provider in FireStore 

2.  ##### Creating new sign-up component 

3.  ##### Creating new sign-in component 

4.  ##### Refactoring Buttons into seperate component

4.  ##### Refactoring Form-inputs into seperate component

5.  ##### Renaming Sign-in to Authentication 

<br><br>

### Adding Context - using react-context

<hr>

The users profile will be present in many components throughout the app
(Such as a Signing-in, profile management, shopping cart etc.)
Will require having to have access to the 'user' context through out the app

1.  ##### Creating a Context Folder
    -  Created a user.context.jsx file, using; 
        -  useState  
        -  createContext

    -  Created UserContext to store the users data (& null as defaults),
       as well as export into components.

    -  Create `userProvider` to pass this into/wrap the entire app. 
    -  Obviously wrapped the app inside <userProvider> in Main.jsx
    
2. ##### Giving Sign-in Form access to the context
    -  When 'user' signs in, store the 'user' into the context
    -  Added `useContext` &  imported the `context` object
    -  Added the `SetCurrentUser` functionality to the Sign-in method
    -  Running `SetCurrent` user if sign-in promise returns a 'user'.
    -  (Both For google and email sign in)  

3.  ##### Accessing Context in the Navigation component 
    -  Added `UseContext` & imported the `context` object
    -  Added the currentUser = useContext(UserContext)

4.  ##### Giving Sign-up Form access to the context
    -  When 'user' creates an account, store 'user' into the context
    -  Added `useContext` &  imported the `context` object
    -  Added the `SetCurrentUser` functionality to the Sign-in method
    -  Running `SetCurrent` user if sign-in promise returns a 'user'

5.  ##### Updating Navigation bar with conditional (ternary)
    -  If user signed in, 'sign-in' link should turn into 'sign-out'
    -  Simple Conditional (ternary) operator in the jsx


<br><br>

### Adding Sign-Out Functionality 

<hr>

Obviously once the user is signed in, they will need to be able to sign-out.

1.  #####  Adding Sign-Out Functionality in FireBase Utils
    [Sign-Out Doc's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/auth#signout)
    -  imported `signOut` from firebase/auth
    -  Created an export for `signOutUser`


2.  #####  Import signout user into Navigation component 
    -  Imported the `SignOut` Function from `FireBase Utils`
    -  Updated the conditional sign-out link with an onClick with `signOutUser`


3.  ##### Created Sign-Out Handler Function 
    -  await `signOutUser`
    -  then `setCurrentUser` = null;  
    -  updated the sign-out link to use the `signOutHandler`

<br><br>

###  Just as I finished this I learned read about Observer's and onAuthStateChange

<hr>

[onAuthStateChanged](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users#get_the_currently_signed-in_user)

This is actually essential otherwise the user will have this unwanted persistent-signed-in-state - i.e. the user will remain signed-in, even if we refresh the page.

The problem being it will appear if we have to sign-in again but in the console if we log our user, it will show the last signed in user.

Additionally we dont need to hook into the sign and sign out components any longer and therefore don't have to re-run all those fucntions on a change - instead our onAuthStateChange listener will do this for us.  

Ultimatly saving some computing power.  Wish I read about this before coding all that. lol


1.  ##### In the fireBase utils file; 
    - imported this on AuthChange 
    - created an export for it

2.  ##### In the user.context file;
    - added the `useEffect` Hook 
    - added new functions from `firebase.utils`
    - created a hook that will track the authChange;
        - Needed to prevent a memory leak
        - Needed to use effect cleanup to dispose when no longer needed.

3.  ##### In the sign-in and sign-up components;
    no longer require to run the functions everytime a change in sign-in occurs , therefore;
    - removed all `context` imports
    - removed all `setCurrentUser` functions

    - Google sign in function;
        - removed `createUserDocumentFromAuth`
        - added this function to the user.context
        (the above can't be done with sign-up)

4.  ##### In the Navigation components;
    - no longer required to `setCurrentUser`
    - removed `signOutHandler` function


<br><br>


###  Mocking Shop-Data and scaffolding the actual 'Shop' page

<hr>

1.  #####  Mocking Shop Data and building functionality 
    Created a simple JSON file with some simple clothing store items (just hats).  I will use this to mock having content for the store temporarily while I finish building some of the essential functionality, then later I will remove/replace the hard coded shop data. 


2.  #####  Creating a Shop Page Route
    -  Imported React-Context
    -  Imported the ProductsContext and destructuring to get the 'products' source 
    -  Mapping over the Products to display individual items on the site 

3.  #####  Creating a Products.Context File
    -  Imported `create context` and `shop-data`
    -  Created ProductsContext export 
    -  Created ProducsProvider export to wrap the app inside

4.    ##### Amending the Main.jsx
    -  I want the products be able to access the user context
    (this could be a debate but for my app, I think this would be the simplest)
    -  Wrapped the <App> inside <ProductsProvider>

5.    ##### Amending the APP.jsx
    -  Removed the old temporary 'blank' shop page
    -  Imported the newly created shop component 


6.  #####  Creating a 'product-card' component - basic styling
    -  Imported Button component
    -  Created basic scss styling sheet and imported into the component 
    -  Getting individual clothing items from passing in the products and destructuring (This will rely on receiving the individual items in the Shop.route file - via mapping)
    -  Created layout of the card and returning the following in the card;
        -  Image
        -  Name
        -  Price
        -  Button 

<br><br>


###  Creating Cart-Icon with a DropDown Menu

<hr>

1.  #####  Created a Cart Icon
    -  Added SVG image to the assets folder

2.  #####  Creating Cart-icon Component
    -  Imported styles sheet, SVG file, 
    -  Created a function to set the cartContext from false to true 
    -  Function is run with an onClick (Cart-Icon Button) 

3.  ##### Updating the Navigation to include the Cart -Icon
    -  updated the overall styling to make things easier to look at.
    -  added the cart-component 
    -  added the drop-down component

4.  #####  Creating Cart-Dropdown Component 
    - simple layout with button for a checkout (future)
    - created simple styling 

5.  #####  Creating Cart Context
    - Very simple setup - is the cart open set to false by default
    - Set the cart open 

    - Imported CardProvider to App.js
    - Imported isCartOpen to Navigation using a short-circuit operator (&&)


<br><br>


###  Adding Basic Functionality to the Cart

<hr>

1.  #####  Create a CartItem Component 
    -  Created simple cart item that will return, using `destructuring` ;
        -  the `Image` of the item
        -  the `Name` of item
        -  the `Price` of the item (`Quantity x Price`)

2.  #####  Amending the CartContext 
    -  In the `CartContext`;
        -  Added `CartItems Array` 
        -  Added `addItemToCart` function 
    
    -  In the `CartProvider`;
        -  Added useState  `[cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);`
        -  Added `addItemToCart` function 
        -  Updated the value to include `cartItems` & `addItemToCart`

    -  Created new export `addCartItem` helper funciton;
        -  This will be a helper function to see if newly added items exist in the cart already.
        -  Therefore will know how to handle the quantity inside in the cart.
        -  (i.e. - if product exists in the cart: plus quantity by 1, else add item to the cart)


3.  #####  Added CartItem into the Cart-Dropdown component
    -  Imported the `Cart-Item` compnent 
    -  Imported the `useContext` & `Cart.Context`
    -  From the CartContext I used destructuring to get the `cartItems`

    -  In the return, created a function to map over the cartItems ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
    
    -  Wrapped the above in a ternary conditional using `cartItems.length`
        - if there is a length, return the above
        - if there is no length, thus empty = return a message cart is empty
            - added styling for empty cart message.

4.  #####  Updated Button functionality in Product.Card Component 
    -  Imported `useContext` & `Cart.Context`
    -  Added the `AddItemToCart` method via destructing from `Cart.Context`
    -  In the Button, 
        -  added onClick handler to call the `AddItemToCart` as a fucntion
        -  passing the `product` through the function 
    
    - In Hindsight I took the above button function and made it a function called `addProductToCart`
    - Then passed it into the onClick Handler
    (better for readability and optimization)


<br><br>

###  Adding count to the Cart.Icon

<hr>

1.  #####  Initial Approach
    -  Created a simple count of the items 
    -  Created an empty array
    -  Created a for loop to loop over cartItems and extract the quantity  and push to the empty array
    -  Using reducer to get the total of the array 

    This is working, however in hindsight I might want to be able to use this functionality in the checkout.(still to be built)
    
    "If an item should be removed from the cart ( this functionality has not yet been implemented), the number should decrease."

    It would be better if this functionality was in the cart.context.
    It could also be solved by using the useEffect Hook 

2. #####  Second Attempt - 


<br><br>
