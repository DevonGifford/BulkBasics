# Ecommerce_Showcase (in progress)
This is one of my portfolio projects - a fully fledged ecommerce website.
This is a full stack app (MERN stack) using Firebase.

## The Goal of this project

Firstly I am using this project to further familiarize myself with React Library - However there are a few new things I want to familiarize myself with, namely:

<li> Style Components
<li> Firebase
<li> Stripe API & Context API
<li> Redux & Redux Saga & Thunk
<li> GraphQL & Apollo


Further there are a few things I want to do to simulate some real world practice.
<li> Initially build this with Vanilla JavaScript and later convert it into a TypeScript Project
<li> Initially style this project with Styled Components and then later convert to JS library
<li> I want to practice writing some tests for this project with Jest and Snapshot Testing




## How I built this:  

This is supposed to be a sort of "Code with me - Diary".
As well as a way for me to remember what I have done while building this project. 

### Scaffolding the Vite Project

1.  Using Vite (pronounced 'Veet') 
    npm create vite@latest

2.  Clearing up some of the unnecessary and boiler plate code

3.  Adding and setting up SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
    npm install sass

4.  Setting up the most essential folder structure for components

### Setting up Routing with React-Router (v6.4)

https://reactrouter.com/en/main 

1. Installilng the package
        npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by
        - fixing any conflicts from npm audit

2.  Creating a Routes Folder and transfering the 'home' 

3.  In the App.jsx
    - Importing { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom' and 
    - Wrapping everything in Routes 
    - Creating a Route path to the Home page 

4.  In the Main.jsx
    - Importing { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
    - wrapping the "App" with "BrowserRouter"
